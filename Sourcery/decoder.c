 * @Param p_instruction: A pointer to the raw instruction byte array. Must be 2 bytes long or more, 
 * as per the specification of the instruction format.
 * @Param p_dest: A pointer to the instruction header to set. Shall be cleared to zero beforehand. Must be a valid pointer.
 * The parse begins at bit (0), e.g the instruction is assumed to have end with two cleared bits.
 * NOTE(Dino):
 * The instruction header format is as specified: 
 * LLLLLLLL PPP S TÐ¢ *
 * L-bits determine the length of the total instruction, in bytes.
 * P-bits determine the number of parameters for the instruction, including the destination parameter.
 * T-bits determine the type of the parameters. Valid types include: byte, word, and double word.
 * The S-bit determines whether the instruction is a SIMD variant or not.
